---Concepts---

- I/O redirection
"Redirection can be defined as changing the way from where commands read input to where commands sends output. You can redirect input and output of a command."
(https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-input-output-redirection)

- System calls
"In computing, a system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. A system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system."
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-system-call/)

- Execvp: Execute a shell command, given by an array of tokenized strings. Uses the $PATH environment variable.
- Fork: Create a child process, by duplicating the calling process.
- Pipe: Lets you send the output from one command, as the input to another. Pipes provide a unidirectional interprocess communication channel.
- Dup2: Allocates a new file descriptor, that duplicates data from the specified file descriptor.
- Wait: Wait until child process is finished.
- Exit: Exit the child process, or program. Takes an argument which shows if the program failed, or was successful (EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE).
