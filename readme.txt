Requirements: Cmake, make

How to install Cmake and make:
-Type "sudo apt install Cmake".
-Type "sudo apt install make".


To use the shell, download the zipfile, and extract it. Open your terminal, and direct yourself to the directory in which you have the files. 
Type "mkdir build", followed by "cd build", and finally "cmake --/". Now you will have a makefile in the directory.
Type "make" and now you should have a file called "Shell". Type "./Shell" and now your shell should be working.
